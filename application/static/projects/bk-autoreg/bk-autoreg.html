<div>
    Admin (Flask) + Autoregressor working on Amazon AWS server and Indigo Browser Api.
    In the admin panel, there is an option to unload to excel, filtering by error code (if, for example, proxy failed or registration is not confirmed).


    Previously software was on the requests, until the protection has not improved. In the future I plan to improve this point
