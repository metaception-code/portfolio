    Working for GeniusGroup, I took Apache SuperSet as a basis and refined it by adding cloacking links
    (wrapping links in 0x0 to further view statistics), synchronization with ClickHouse DB and Renta ad cabinet.
    Significantly redesigned the functionality, adding new features:
    roles, changing the display for certain rights, graphics, appearance in Vue Js and more!
